# Wordle Helper!

A guess generating aid for playing the game [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/)! 

_Note: This small project is just for my own fun and if I post results from this anywhere I make it clear that the results were produced with the aid of a computer. By no means am I trying to ruin the spirit of Wordle!_

_Also, the dictionaries I used are just from some random, generic word lists online. They aren't specific to the past or future Wordle answers._

## How to Use:
For now (and probably always) it just writes to the CLI. There are a few different capabilities in Wordle Helper:
### **Single Guess Helper** 
Input known information (green, yellow, gray letters) in the correct spots and have Wordle Helper help you pick your next word (the algorithm/scoring system is explained a bit more below). You can uncomment the code below at the bottom of the file _main.py_ (or just copy and paste from here). Fill in the letters in the correct spots and run _main.py_!
```
correct_spots = ['', '', '', '', '']  # Green letters
wrong_spots = ['', '', '', '', '']  # Yellow letters
wrong_letters = ''  # Gray letters
next_guess_count = 1  # e.g. 1 -> 1st guess

scored_list = wordle_helper(correct_spots, wrong_spots, wrong_letters, next_guess_count)
for word, score in scored_list[:20]:  # Only prints the top 20 words
    print(word, score)
```
### **Simulate Guessing a Wordle (Multi Guess)** 
Using the _simulate_word(word)_ function, you can simulate continuous guesses until the Wordle is guessed. The output is a list of every guess, (hopefully) ending with the Wordle!

In **main.py**:
```
simulate_single_word('apple')
simulate_single_word('enjoy')
```
Output:
```
Guesses:  ['arose', 'alien', 'amble', 'apple']
Guesses:  ['arose', 'noted', 'enjoy']
```
### **Simulate Guessing Many Wordles** 
To test the above function across many Wordles, fill the file **past_answers.txt** with Wordles and run the function _calculate_average_guess_metric()_ in **main.py**. You can also specify the number of Wordles to simulate.

In **main.py**:
```
simulate_many_words(10)
```
Output:
```
Inputs:  ['solar', 'shire', 'proxy', 'point', 'robot', 'prick', 'wince', 'crimp', 'knoll', 'sugar']
Guesses:  ['arose', 'solar']
Guesses:  ['arose', 'shirt', 'shire']
Guesses:  ['arose', 'until', 'broch', 'proxy']
Guesses:  ['arose', 'tonic', 'point']
Guesses:  ['arose', 'intro', 'throw', 'robot']
Guesses:  ['arose', 'until', 'crimp', 'prick']
Guesses:  ['arose', 'until', 'hinge', 'mince', 'vince', 'wince']
Guesses:  ['arose', 'until', 'crimp']
Guesses:  ['arose', 'until', 'knoll']
Guesses:  ['arose', 'stair', 'sugar']
Average Num Guesses per Wordle: 3.5
Max Num Guesses: 6   Word: wince
Distribution:
	 1 guess(es): 0
	 2 guess(es): 1
	 3 guess(es): 5
	 4 guess(es): 3
	 5 guess(es): 0
	 6 guess(es): 1
```

## How it Works:
### V3 (current version) - Averages 3.77 guesses per word
- Improved word lists to allowable words by Wordle (rather than trying to source my own lists from other dictionaries online)
- Improved guessing for when many similar words remain (paste, taste, haste, etc...)


### V2 - Averages 4.07 guesses per word
### With early guesses, the program tries to gather maximum information using the frequency of letters in words.
- Uses both dictionary letter frequencies and text letter frequencies to score words
- If on the first guess, you get a green letter, you don't need to (necessarily) guess this green letter in the second clue if you are trying to maximize information.
- Duplicate letters in a guess are punished (they likely obtain less information than guessing two different letters)
### With later guesses (usually around the third guess), the program begins attempting to guess the actual word.
- Two word lists: a simpler list of more common five letters words and a larger, more complete word list. Words on common list score a little higher.
- In scoring, punishes dictionary words ending with an s (higher likelihood of being plural). Wordle doesn't often pick plurals. There are some false positives with this and the program attempts to correct for this (i.e. if the word ends in "ss" or "us" it is less likely to be a plural and so these although they end with "s" aren't punished by the word scoring system).
- A small rare letter bonus kicks into scoring after the first two guesses. It appears to me Wordle tries to include words using unique letters (QUERY, PROXY, KNOLL) so we will keep this in mind when evaluating potential words.

### Past results (from always guessing the first recommended word produced in the list)
- #219 - KNOLL (arose, tonic, blown, knoll)
- #218 - CRIMP (arose, until, frizz, brick, crimp)
- #217 - WINCE (arose, unite, binge, mince, vince, wince)
- #216 - PRICK (arose, until, frizz, brick, prick)
- #215 - ROBOT (arose, intro, throw, robot)
- #214 - POINT (arose, tonic, joint, point)
- #213 - PROXY (arose, intro, proxy)
- #212 - SHIRE (arose, resin, spire, swire, shire)
- #211 - SOLAR (arose, solar)
- #210 - PANIC (arose, latin, mania, panic)
- #209 - TANGY (arose, latin, gaunt, tangy)
- #208 - ABBEY (arose, alien, abbey)
- #207 - FAVOR (arose, ratio, major, favor)
- #206 - DRINK (arose, until, wring, briny, drink)
- #205 - QUERY (arose, inert, query)
- #204 - GORGE (arose, other, forge, gorge)

### Heuristics
#### Determine when to guess for information vs when to guess for likely word.  -0.08 guesses per Wordle
- When making a guess, after the list of potential words is scored, the program looks at the score difference between the most likely word and the fifth most likely word. If the difference is small, the program continues to guess for "maximizing information" as it still doesn't really have a good idea what the most likely word is. If the difference is large, it will guess the top (most likely) word as something significant about that word is causing it to score higher than the rest.
#### Use multiple word lists based on how common a word is. More common words score higher.  -0.26 guesses per Wordle 
- Three tiers of word lists are used (most common, more common, and all words). The list of potential words is derived from all words, but individual words get score bonuses if they also appear in the more common or most common lists.
#### When guessing for maximum information, the program doesn't need to guess green letters again.
- A good example of this:
```
Guesses:  ['arose', 'until', 'troll']
```
With the first guess, r and o were in the correct spots. However, with the second guess, guessing n and t discovers that n isn't present in the word and that t is. This, in addition to the other information gathered with the second clue, led the program to guess "troll" with the third guess.


### Optimizations to make upon V2
- Rather than always switching to guessing the word on the third clue, I could base when the switch happens on the number of possible words remaining (i.e. with lots of words remaining on the third guess, you may still want to guess for maximizing information).
- Find an even better dictionary. Every time the word was in the dictionary the word was guessed in 2-4 guesses. The 5+ guesses are from Wordle words not in the more common dictionary I use.

### V1 - Averages ~5.0 guesses per word
- Uses dictionary letter frequencies to score words
### Past results (from always guessing the first recommended word produced in the list)
- #214 - POINT (aires, louin, doing, joint, point)
- #213 - PROXY (aires, yourt, droyl, crony, frowy, grovy, proxy)
- #212 - SHIRE (aires, reist, shire)
- #211 - SOLAR (aires, rosat, sofar, solar)
- #210 - PANIC (aires, lanti, canid, manic, panic)
- #209 - TANGY (aires, laton, tangy)

### Optimizations to make upon V1
- Early guesses should prioritize maximizing information over attempting to guess actual words. Later guesses should attempt to guess actual words. (V1 always just guesses based on trying to maximize information.)
- Find a better dictionary to use with more realistic potential Wordle words
- Explore whether calculating dictionary letter frequencies vs text letter frequencies improves guessing results. Another possibility is to use letter frequencies from historical Wordle answers... maybe worth exploring.
